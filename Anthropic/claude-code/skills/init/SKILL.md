description: Initialize a new CLAUDE.md file with codebase documentation
---

Please analyze this codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file, which will be given to future instances of Claude Code to operate in this repository.

What to add:
1. Commands that will be commonly used, such as how to build, lint, and run tests. Include the necessary commands to develop in this codebase, such as how to run a single test.
2. High-level code architecture and structure so that future instances can be productive more quickly. Focus on the "big picture" architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand.

Usage notes:
- If there's already a CLAUDE.md, suggest improvements to it.
- When you make the initial CLAUDE.md, do not repeat yourself and do not include obvious instructions like "Provide helpful error messages to users", "Write unit tests for all new utilities", "Never include sensitive information (API keys, tokens) in code or commits".
- Avoid listing every component or file structure that can be easily discovered.
- Don't include generic development practices.
- If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include the important parts.
- If there is a README.md, make sure to include the important parts.
- If you find an OpenAI Codex config (~/.codex/config.toml or ./.codex/) or a Gemini CLI config (~/.gemini/settings.json or ./.gemini/ or a GEMINI.md), offer to import it now — tell the user to reply `/import` to scan and list what's importable (MCP servers, slash commands, subagents, skills, instructions), then `/import --yes=<digest>` (the scan output names the digest) to apply the user-level items. Do NOT read the foreign-agent config files or write Claude Code config yourself — the deterministic import (triggered by `--yes`) applies the same safe-name and path-traversal guards as the terminal picker. If `/import` isn't available on this surface, tell the user to run `claude import` from a terminal instead.
- Do not make up information such as "Common Development Tasks", "Tips for Development", "Support and Documentation" unless this is expressly included in other files that you read.
- Be sure to prefix the file with the following text:

```
# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.
```
